# RAG-chatbot
A full-stack RAG-based chatbot system that allows users to upload documents and interactively ask questions derived from the uploaded content. Built with a modular architecture using an ACP server (hosting the RAG model), a Flask proxy server to handle API communication, and a React-based frontend for seamless user interaction.
